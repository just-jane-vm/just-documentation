# overview
a duel is a way to settle difference between chatters.
by starting a duel you get the opportunity to delete another chatters message.

## starting a duel
to start a duel you need to use the reply feature of twitch chat.
reply `!duel` to a chat you want to duel about.
your reply can have any text have `!duel` that you want.

## bang bang
when a duel is started the orbs of the duel participants are put on the screen and gradually move apart while a song plays.
when the music stops the first chatter to use the bang command (!!, !bang, bang bang) is the winner.
winning a duel grants you 1 giga-vip (assuming the person you defeated has won a duel in the past)
